## Session: 2026-01-22
- **Action:** Initialized `.agent` directory structure.

- **Action:** Fixed FAQ Route Conflict.
    - **Problem:** `route('home.faq')` was defined in both `web.php` (frontend) and `admin.php` (admin), causing Admin links to redirect to Frontend.
    - **Fix:** Renamed admin route to `admin.home.faq`.

    - **Admin Table:** Updated `resources/views/administrator/Home/ourContributor/our_contributor.blade.php` to display "View Link" anchor in the list.
    - **Frontend:** Updated `resources/views/website/homepage.blade.php` to wrap logo in link if present.
- **Action:** Add Delete Option to Important Links.
    - **Change:** Added Delete button for Important Links in Admin.
    - **Logic:** Added `deleteLink($id)` to `App\Livewire\Admin\Setting\ImportantLinkSettings.php`.

    - **Commit:** "Fix FAQ route, add Contributor Link, add Important Link Delete, Plain Password fix"
- **Action:** Fix Route Name Conflict.
    - **Problem:** `LogicException` due to duplicate `home.career` route name in `routes/web.php`.
    - **Fix:** Renamed the second definition (`/preparation-course/{course?}`) to `home.preparation_course`.
